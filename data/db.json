      "content": "CSS is a powerful tool for styling web applications. Here are my top 5 tips: 1) Use CSS Custom Properties (variables) for consistent theming and easy maintenance. 2) Master Flexbox and Grid layouts for responsive designs. 3) Implement mobile-first media queries to ensure better responsive development. 4) Utilize CSS animations and transitions for smoother user interactions rather than JavaScript when possible. 5) Keep your selectors specific but not too nested to maintain good performance and readability. These fundamentals have helped me create more maintainable and scalable stylesheets across various projects. Remember, good CSS architecture is just as important as writing the styles themselves!"
